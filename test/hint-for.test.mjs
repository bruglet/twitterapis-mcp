//
// They do NOT catch a REWORD. A future edit could rewrite any of these three
// sentences into something wrong, or copy the timeline sentence back onto the
// feedback route in different words, and every property check above would still
// pass. That is exactly how the original defect survived: it read plausibly.
//
// So the three strings a model actually receives are pinned BYTE FOR BYTE. A
// deliberate reword is then a two-line change, this file and src/index.js, made on
// purpose. A drive-by reword is a failing test. The point is not that these
// sentences are sacred; it is that changing them cannot happen QUIETLY.
