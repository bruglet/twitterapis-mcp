# TwitterAPIs Remote MCP

This fork runs the [twitterapis.com](https://www.twitterapis.com) API as a remote Model Context Protocol service. It keeps the upstream TwitterAPIs tools, schemas, and REST behavior.

## Remote MCP

Use the remote MCP URL with the `/mcp` path:

```text
https://<your-host>/mcp
```

Cloudflare Access handles OAuth before the request reaches this service. The origin validates the `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header. This service does not implement OAuth.

The public health endpoint is:

```text
https://<your-host>/healthz
```

## Configuration

Set these environment variables in the container or Quadlet environment file:

| Environment variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TWITTERAPIS_KEY` | Yes | None | API key from the [twitterapis.com dashboard](https://www.twitterapis.com/dashboard) |
| `TWITTERAPIS_BASE_URL` | No | `https://api.twitterapis.com` | TwitterAPIs REST API host |
| `TWITTERAPIS_TIMEOUT_MS` | No | `30000` | Request timeout in milliseconds |
| `CF_ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` | Yes | None | Cloudflare Access team URL, for example `https://example.cloudflareaccess.com` |
| `CF_ACCESS_AUD` | Yes | None | Cloudflare Access application audience tag |
| `HOST` | No | `0.0.0.0` | HTTP listen address |
| `PORT` | No | `3000` | HTTP listen port |

## Container

Build the image:

```bash
podman build -f Containerfile -t ghcr.io/bruglet/twitterapis-mcp:latest .
```

Run the image with an environment file:

```bash
podman run --rm --env-file "$HOME/.config/twitterapis-mcp/twitterapis-mcp.env" -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 ghcr.io/bruglet/twitterapis-mcp:latest
```

The image uses Node 24, runs as the non-root `node` user, and includes a health check for `/healthz`. Do not put secrets in the image.

## Rootless Quadlet

The Quadlet publishes port `3000` on host loopback only. Cloudflare Tunnel connects to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.

Copy the unit and create its environment file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/containers/systemd ~/.config/twitterapis-mcp
cp deploy/twitterapis-mcp.container ~/.config/containers/systemd/
cp deploy/twitterapis-mcp.env.example ~/.config/twitterapis-mcp/twitterapis-mcp.env
```

Edit the environment file. Then load and start the rootless unit:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now twitterapis-mcp.service
```

The unit uses `AutoUpdate=registry`, restarts after a failure, and loads secrets from the environment file.

## GHCR image

GitHub Actions publishes the image at:

```text
ghcr.io/bruglet/twitterapis-mcp
```

The workflow publishes `latest` and `sha-<commit>` for `main`. It also publishes the matching version tag for a version-tag push.

## Tools

67 registered tools: 63 reads and 4 allowed write actions. Most user endpoints accept `username` (handle without @) **or** `user_id` (`twitter_user_likes` and `twitter_user_tweets_complete` require `user_id`); tweet endpoints accept `id` **or** `url`; paginated endpoints return a `cursor` you pass back to get the next page. Four of the reads are free account lookups (`twitter_account_me`, `twitter_account_payments`, `twitter_feedback_get`, `twitter_feedback_list`); the read-only monitoring tools are also free.

Public reads work with your API key. Account-only reads and 4 allowed write actions usually require a linked X session or per-call credentials. The allowed actions are `twitter_grok_chat`, `twitter_customer_session`, `twitter_customer_session_delete`, and `twitter_user_login`.

The complete upstream catalog contains 99 tools. This fork keeps all generated tool definitions, but it does not register the other 32 write actions. MCP clients cannot list or call those tools. The tables below preserve the complete upstream catalog for synchronization and attribution.

See also `twitter_article_get` and `twitter_article_list` above.

### Monitoring _(webhook delivery of new posts; free, not metered)_

Watch an X account for new posts and get them pushed to your own HTTPS endpoint, HMAC-signed, instead of polling. Register a webhook first, then create a monitor; every new post from a watched handle is delivered to every active webhook on your account (or a restricted subset via `webhook_ids`). Monitor/webhook CRUD is account administration, not a metered Twitter read, so every tool below is free.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `twitter_monitor_create` | Start watching an X account (`handle`) for new posts |
| `twitter_monitor_list` | List every monitor on your account |
| `twitter_monitor_update` | Pause/resume a monitor or change its `webhook_ids` restriction |
| `twitter_monitor_delete` | Stop and remove a monitor (irreversible) |
| `twitter_monitor_health` | One monitor's status, degradation flag, poll interval, cursor position |
| `twitter_monitor_account_health` | Account-wide rollup: service status, active/paused monitor counts, 24h delivery outcome counts, one call |
| `twitter_monitor_deliveries` | Recent delivery events across every monitor, with detection + delivery latency |
| `twitter_x_user_stream_add_user` | Compat drop-in for `twitter_monitor_create` using an x_user_stream-shaped envelope |
| `twitter_x_user_stream_remove_user` | Compat drop-in for `twitter_monitor_delete` using an x_user_stream-shaped envelope |
| `twitter_x_user_stream_list_users` | Compat drop-in for `twitter_monitor_list` using an x_user_stream-shaped envelope |
| `twitter_monitor_webhook_create` | Register an HTTPS delivery URL; returns the HMAC signing secret **once** |
| `twitter_monitor_webhook_list` | List every webhook registered on your account |
| `twitter_monitor_webhook_delete` | Soft-delete a webhook by id (irreversible from the caller's side) |
| `twitter_monitor_webhook_test` | Send one signed test event to a webhook right now, synchronously |
| `twitter_monitor_webhook_redrive` | Replay deliveries that dead-lettered while your endpoint was down, oldest first |

### Feedback _(report a bug or a gap to the twitterapis.com team without leaving your session; free)_

Modelled on Claude Code's own feedback tool. When a call fails in a way that is not your key, credits, session or a rate limit, when you ask for something no tool covers, or when a result is plainly wrong, the model can **draft** a report into a local queue (`~/.twitterapis/feedback-queue.json`, at most 10 drafts, override the directory with `TWITTERAPIS_FEEDBACK_DIR`). Nothing is sent until you ask to review the queue and name the drafts to send. Each report carries the last failing call's endpoint, status and request id, your client name and this package's version, so the team can act on it without a follow-up. Use `twitter_feedback_get` with the returned server id to see whether it was triaged, shipped or declined.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `twitter_feedback_send` | `action: "draft"` (default) queues a report locally and sends nothing; `"list"` shows the queue; `"send"` posts only the drafts you name to `POST /feedback`; `"discard"` drops them |
| `twitter_feedback_get` | Read a sent report's status (`new`, `triaged`, `shipped`, `declined`) and the team's response |
| `twitter_feedback_list` | List the reports this account has already sent, newest first, with `status`/`type` filters and a `cursor` to page |

### Session setup

Link an X account to your key once, so the account-only reads and write actions act as it (or pass per-call `auth_token`/`ct0` instead).

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `twitter_customer_session` | Register your x.com session cookies (`auth_token` + `ct0`) against your key |
| `twitter_customer_session_status` | Read your registered session status without changing it _(session)_ |
| `twitter_customer_session_delete` | Revoke that stored session, deleting your `auth_token` + `ct0` from the service. Idempotent and free |
| `twitter_user_login` | Log in with `username` + `password` (+ `totp_secret` for 2FA); stores the session against your key. Returns a confirmation, never the cookies |

## Upstream attribution

### Search for trending AI tweets

> "Find the most popular tweets about AI agents posted this week"

The agent calls `twitter_advanced_search` with:
```
query: "AI agents min_faves:200 since:2024-01-01"
product: "Top"
count: 20
```

### Pull a user's recent posts

> "Get the last 10 tweets from @sama"

The agent calls `twitter_user_tweets` with:
```
username: "sama"
count: 10
```

### Read a full thread

> "Get the full thread for this tweet: https://x.com/karpathy/status/1849....."

The agent calls `twitter_tweet_thread` with:
```
url: "https://x.com/karpathy/status/1849....."
```

### Paginate through followers

> "List the first 100 followers of @openai, then the next 100"

First call, `twitter_user_followers`: `{ username: "openai", count: 100 }`
Second call, pass back the `cursor` from the first response: `{ username: "openai", count: 100, cursor: "<cursor from response>" }`

### Paging `twitter_user_tweets_complete`

> "Pull @elonmusk's whole tweet history"

`twitter_user_tweets_complete` auto-paginates server-side and returns a large batch per call, but it does **not** guarantee the full history in one call. Read the result like this:

- **`next_cursor` is the completion signal, not `count`.** Non-null means the history is truncated and more remains. Null means it is genuinely exhausted. The response also carries `has_more`, the same signal as a boolean.
- **`max` is a minimum target, not a cap.** Pages arrive in whole chunks, so a response may hold up to one page (<=100) more than requested. Live behaviour: `max=10` returned 20, `max=50` returned 60, `max=150` returned 161, and omitting `max` (server default **200**) returned 201. Never assume `count === max`.
- **Each call also has a server-side wall-clock budget**, so a response can be truncated even when it returned fewer tweets than requested. That is the second reason `count` cannot tell you whether you are done.
- **Billing is a flat $0.0024 per call**, regardless of how many tweets come back, so fewer large calls cost less than many small ones.

To resume, pass the `next_cursor` straight back in as `cursor` and repeat until it comes back null:

First call, `twitter_user_tweets_complete`: `{ user_id: "44196397", max: 800 }`
Then, while `next_cursor` is non-null: `{ user_id: "44196397", max: 800, cursor: "<next_cursor from previous response>" }`

### Monitor brand mentions

> "Show me recent tweets mentioning @twitterapis"

The agent calls `twitter_user_mentions` with:
```
username: "twitterapis"
count: 50
```

## Troubleshooting

**`HTTP 401 (invalid or missing API key)`** Check that `TWITTERAPIS_KEY` is set correctly in your MCP client config and matches the key shown in your [dashboard](https://www.twitterapis.com/dashboard).

**`HTTP 402 (insufficient credits)`** Top up at [twitterapis.com/dashboard](https://www.twitterapis.com/dashboard). Your first $0.50 is free at signup.

**`HTTP 403 (access forbidden)`** The account or tweet may be private/protected, or your plan does not include this endpoint.

**`HTTP 404 (not found)`** The user, tweet, or list may have been deleted, suspended, or the id/handle is wrong.

**`HTTP 429 (rate limited)`** Wait a few seconds and retry. If you hit this frequently, add `"TWITTERAPIS_TIMEOUT_MS": "60000"` to your env config and space out bulk requests.

**`Request failed: timed out after 30000ms`** The default timeout is 30 s. For large paginated fetches set `TWITTERAPIS_TIMEOUT_MS` to a higher value (e.g. `60000`).

**Tools do not appear in Claude / Cursor** Ensure `npx` is on your PATH and Node.js 18+ is installed (`node --version`). Check MCP client logs for startup errors.

## Pricing

Calls are billed to your twitterapis.com account. Almost every endpoint is $0.0008/call: all reads (search, profiles, tweets, followers, likes) plus the simple write actions (like, retweet, bookmark, follow and their undos, delete). At the read rate that works out to $0.04 per 1,000 tweets, since each call returns about 20 tweets. The premium endpoints cost a little more: tweet creation, sending a DM (`twitter_dm_send`), and DM reads (`twitter_dm_list`, `twitter_dm_conversation`) at $0.0016/call, full tweet history (`twitter_user_tweets_complete`) at $0.0024/call, a full tweet thread (`twitter_tweet_thread`) and a Grok answer (`twitter_grok_chat`) at $0.004/call, and the article-editing writes (`twitter_article_create`, `twitter_article_update_title`, `twitter_article_update_cover_media`, `twitter_article_update_content`, `twitter_article_publish`, `twitter_article_unpublish`) at $0.0016/call (`twitter_article_get`, `twitter_article_list`, and `twitter_article_delete` stay at the standard $0.0008/call). Your first $0.50 is free. See [twitterapis.com/pricing](https://www.twitterapis.com/pricing).

## FAQ

**Do I need an X (Twitter) developer account?** No. Get an API key at [twitterapis.com/signup](https://www.twitterapis.com/signup); there is no application or approval step.

**Is it read-only?** It exposes 63 read tools and the four approved actions listed above. The other 32 upstream write actions are not registered.

**Which clients are supported?** Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and VS Code (Copilot agent mode), or any Model Context Protocol client.

**How is it billed?** Per request. New keys start with $0.50 in free credits, no card required. See [pricing](https://www.twitterapis.com/pricing).

**Does it store my key or data?** No. The server holds no state and forwards your API key on each call.

## Maintainers

This fork is based on [TwitterAPIs/twitterapis-mcp](https://github.com/TwitterAPIs/twitterapis-mcp). It keeps the upstream MIT license, tool catalog, and TwitterAPIs behavior.

`src/tools.js` is **generated**. Do not edit it. The catalog is built at build time from two committed inputs:

- `test/openapi.snapshot.json`, a vendored copy of the published OpenAPI spec, which supplies the structure: which endpoints exist, which parameters each accepts, whether a parameter is required, and its type.
- `scripts/tools.overrides.mjs`, hand-authored, which supplies everything the spec cannot express: the tool and argument descriptions a model reads to decide how to call a tool, the cross-field rules ("provide exactly one of `username` or `user_id`"), the per-call credential arguments that travel as `x-*` headers, and the write / destructive / JSON-body flags.

The spec is vendored on purpose. Nothing is fetched at install time or at server boot, so the service does not depend on a hostname still answering.

```bash
npm run openapi:refresh   # re-vendor the spec, prints the route diff
npm run build             # regenerate src/tools.js
npm test                  # gates, incl. "src/tools.js matches the generator"
```

`npm test` fails if `src/tools.js` was hand-edited or left stale, if the catalog and the live spec disagree, or if the tool list and this README disagree.
