//
// scripts/gen-tools.mjs reads test/openapi.snapshot.json for the STRUCTURE it can
// prove (which endpoints exist, which params each one accepts, whether a param is
// required, and its base type) and reads THIS file for everything the spec cannot
// express:
//
//   - the agent-facing tool description, which is what a model actually reads to
//     decide whether and how to call a tool. The spec's own descriptions are
//     endpoint documentation for a human with the docs page open, they average a
//     fraction of the length, and they carry none of the "use X instead when Y"
//     routing between sibling tools.
//   - the per-arg descriptions, which carry cross-field rules a per-field spec has
//     nowhere to put, for example "Provide exactly one of username or user_id".
//   - the per-call inline credential block, which travels as x-* request headers
//     and therefore appears in no spec at all.
//   - the write / destructive / jsonBody flags, which drive the MCP annotations a
//     client shows before a mutating call, and which the spec does not model.
//
// Rules of the road:
//   - Every arg name here must be a real param of that endpoint in the spec, or
//     be marked header:true. The build FAILS otherwise.
//   - Every spec param must either appear in args or be listed in omit with a
//     reason. The build FAILS otherwise, so a param added upstream cannot be
//     silently ignored.
//   - required-ness and base type are DERIVED from the spec. Set them here only
//     to deviate deliberately, and say why in the neighbouring comment.
//   - After editing this file run `npm run build`.
//   - BEFORE adding a new write:true tool, or copy-pasting one as a template:
//     open the corresponding route handler in products/twitterapis-backend and
//     check whether it reads `c.req.json()` directly (needs jsonBody:true here)
//     or goes through resolveBodyParam/similar dual-mode query-or-body helper
//     (jsonBody can stay unset). Getting this wrong is NOT caught by any test
//     in THIS repo -- gen-tools.mjs and catalog-identity.mjs only check internal
//     consistency, never whether jsonBody actually matches what the backend
//     reads. Incident 2026-08-16: 5 tools (twitter_monitor_create/update,
//     twitter_monitor_webhook_create, twitter_x_user_stream_add_user/
//     remove_user) shipped with jsonBody unset while their backend handlers
//     read ONLY the JSON body -- every call to any of them failed with a 400,
//     for an unknown period, caught only by an independent code-review pass
//     that happened to trace one call path all the way into the sibling repo.
//     Verify with a REAL live call (see test/smoke.mjs for the pattern), not
//     just by reading the route -- a static read is a hypothesis, not proof.
