// reconcile-mcp-publish-chain.mjs — MCP PUBLISH-CHAIN parity gate (read-only).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (the fail-open it closes)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// test/openapi-parity.mjs reconciles the MCP tool catalog against the OpenAPI
// snapshot, and test/firewall.mjs scans what `npm pack` WOULD upload. Both read
// the local working tree. Neither can answer the only question a customer's
// install actually depends on:
//
//     is the package on the registry the same code as the repo?
//
// The MCP server travels a publish chain, and every hop in it is a MANUAL step
// that can silently not happen:
//
//   (1) REPO   TwitterAPIs/twitterapis-mcp @ origin/main
//         │
//         │  hop — a human runs `npm publish`
//         ▼
//   (2) NPM    @twitterapis/mcp             (scoped, what customers install)
//
// If the publish never runs, every local gate still reports GREEN over a
// published package that is missing the fix. That is a fail-open, and it is not
// hypothetical: a sibling property on this operator's fleet hit exactly this. Its
// MCP package was published as 0.1.1 while its repo also said 0.1.1, and the two
// were DIFFERENT — only 1 of 6 files matched. Customers' agents were running a
// stale tool description.
//
// THE VERSION TRAP (why a version check is not enough)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// In that incident the version strings AGREED while the bytes did not. A gate
// that compared versions would have reported parity over live drift. So this gate
// reconciles by CONTENT HASH PER FILE, and treats "same version, different bytes"
// as the single most severe finding it can emit, because that is the state in
// which every cheaper check lies to you.
//
// TOPOLOGY IS PER-PROPERTY — DO NOT ASSUME A SIBLING'S SHAPE (2026-07-20)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This gate is a port of one written for a sibling property, and the most important
// thing that did NOT port is the number of hops.
//
//   a MIRRORED property :  AUTHORED (monorepo subdir) -> PUBLISH REPO -> NPM  2 hops
//   THIS property       :  REPO (authoring source) -> NPM                     1 hop
//
// A property that authors its MCP inside a monorepo and MIRRORS it into a separate
// publish repo has a middle surface that can go stale on its own. This repo has no
// such mirror: it IS both the authoring source and the publish source. Verified
// 2026-07-20 — every checkout of `@twitterapis/mcp` on the build machine resolves
// to this one remote, and no monorepo copy exists.
//
// So the chain is declared as an ORDERED LIST OF SURFACES per tenant, and the hops
// are DERIVED from it, rather than three surfaces being baked into the control
// flow. A two-surface tenant yields one hop; a three-surface tenant yields the two
// adjacent hops plus the end-to-end hop that is what customers actually feel.
// Hardcoding "3 surfaces, 2 hops" here would have produced a gate that reports on
// a mirror repo this tenant does not have — decoration that passes green because
// it is comparing a surface against itself.
//
// WHERE THIS GATE RUNS, AND WHY IT IS NOT A PRE-COMMIT HOOK
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The sibling shipped this wired into a pre-commit hook and had to remove it. The
// defect is worth restating so it is not reintroduced here: the hook fired on the
// commit that STAGED the MCP change and the gate read the WORKING TREE, so the act
// of fixing a file is precisely what makes REPO differ from NPM. The gate then
// blocked the very commit that fixed the drift, and every legitimate PR needed a
// bypass. A gate that is bypassed on every legitimate use is OFF.
//
// The publish chain is a property of what has LANDED, not of what is being typed.
// So enforcement lives in the three places where the question is well-posed:
//
//   1. THE MERGE PATH  (--mode=merge-path, run LOCALLY against the merge result)
//      GitHub Actions is permanently off for this org and no workflow may be
//      authored, so this mode is invoked by hand before a merge, never by CI.
//      Runs on the PR merge result. Content drift here is EXPECTED and legitimate
//      — the PR is the fix, and reconciling it requires a publish, which is an
//      operator action that cannot happen inside CI. Content drift is therefore
//      reported as PUBLISH DEBT (advisory), not blocked.
//      What IS blocked is the one thing the PR author can fix in the PR:
//      SILENT-STALE. If the repo's publish set now differs from the published
//      package while BOTH still carry the same version string, the change is
//      unshippable — npm immutability means that version can never carry these
//      bytes. Bumping the version resolves it, in the same PR, by the author.
//
//   2. THE SCHEDULED RECONCILE  (--mode=reconcile, the default)
//      Runs against origin/main on a timer, via scripts/mcp-chain-reconcile.sh.
//      Everything blocks. This is the mode that catches the live drift class,
//      which NO COMMIT CAUSES: main landed a fix weeks ago and nobody ever ran the
//      publish. There is no commit to hang a hook on and no CI run to attach a
//      check to, so only a timer sees it. Deliberately runnable WITHOUT GitHub
//      Actions so it can be armed from a laptop/cron independently of CI.
//
//   3. PRE-PUBLISH  (--mode=reconcile --publish-intent, operator-run)
//      The one moment the operator can still prevent a bad publish rather than
//      report one afterwards.
//
// BYPASSES
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// There is no env var that disables this gate. The only bypass is
// --allow-uncertified-identity, which can never certify anything, and any active
// bypass is NAMED in the gate's own output on every run, pass or fail, so a
// weakened run can never be mistaken for a clean one. A retired env bypass from the
// pre-commit era is detected and REFUSED, so that muscle memory cannot silence this
// gate either.
//
// TENANT ISOLATION (do not "fix" the split)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// This property is a standalone brand and this package ships to a public registry,
// so no foreign-property identity may appear on it. The gate asserts that on the
// PUBLISHED artifact (check 6 + check 9) rather than trusting that a local
// pre-publish scan ran — test/firewall.mjs checks what WOULD ship, this checks what
// ALREADY DID. Those are different questions, and only the second is about the
// artifact customers already have.
//
// Check 9 carries NO roster of its own. It DELEGATES to the operator's isolation
// registry, exactly as test/firewall.mjs does, for exactly the same reason: this
// repository is PUBLIC, so a hardcoded list of the identities being firewalled
// would itself publish the association it exists to prevent — a worse leak than
// any single string it could catch. The registry owns the matching semantics
// (bare case-insensitive substrings, never \b word boundaries, because a \b match
// misses the prefixed forms that actually leak) and the per-property carve-outs.
// One implementation, so the rules cannot drift between this gate and everything
// else that enforces them. A registry that cannot be located is a FAIL.
//
// WHO PUBLISHED IT (the identity gap)
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Content parity answers "is the code the same". It does not answer "who put it
// there". `repository.url` inside a published tarball is a field the PUBLISHER
// writes, so it validates a CLAIM, not an identity: a package republished from a
// hostile or simply wrong npm account, with repository.url set correctly, passes
// a content check green.
//
// The authoritative signal is registry-controlled and cannot be forged by the
// publisher: `_npmUser` (who ran the publish) and `maintainers` (who may). Those
// come back on the `npm view --json` metadata this gate already fetches. Check 7
// asserts both. Check 8 runs `npm whoami` and compares it BEFORE a publish, so a
// publish about to happen from the wrong account is caught while it is still
// reversible. Under --publish-intent an unresolvable whoami is a FAIL, not a skip:
// "no token configured" is exactly the state in which a publish silently goes out
// as whoever happens to be logged in.
//
// SHAPE WARNING — do not "simplify" the identity normalizer. `npm view --json`
// serializes these fields as STRINGS ("<user> <email>"), while the raw registry
// packument returns OBJECTS ({name, email}). Reading `meta._npmUser.name` gets
// `undefined` on the live path. Both shapes are parsed; anything that parses to
// neither is a FAIL, never a skip.
//
// npm usernames follow NO pattern across properties, and the GitHub org casing is
// asymmetric too (`TwitterAPIs` on GitHub, lowercase everywhere else). None of it
// is derivable from the package name. Every value in the TENANTS table below was
// READ FROM THE REGISTRY, not inferred.
//
// WHAT IS COMPARED — THE UNION, NOT ONE SURFACE
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The comparison set is the UNION of every surface's independently enumerated
// publish set. Deriving the file list from the upstream surface alone makes a
// whole defect class invisible: a file that exists only DOWNSTREAM is never
// enumerated, so it is never hashed, so it cannot be reported — the gate cannot
// see a file it was not told to look for.
//
// Files that never reach a consumer (test/, package-lock, .tenant, .gitignore)
// stay out of scope: they cannot be the "customer runs stale code" bug this gate
// exists to catch, and including them would add noise that trains people to ignore
// it. They are excluded STRUCTURALLY, by being outside each surface's `files`
// array, not by a hardcoded ignore list.
//
// package.json is compared on a NORMALIZED subset — a DENYLIST, not an allowlist.
// `scripts` is the only excluded field; every other key at every depth is
// compared. An allowlist fails OPEN on every field nobody thought of, and
// package.json grows new consumer-facing fields with every npm release — an
// `exports` map alone decides which files a consumer can import. A denylist fails
// safe: a new field is compared by default, and excluding one is a deliberate,
// reviewable act. `scripts` is excluded because prepublishOnly legitimately
// differs between a repo and a published tarball; it is reported as an advisory.
//
// EXIT CODES
// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//   0  every hop reconciles (or, in merge-path mode, the only findings are debt)
//   1  DRIFT on at least one blocking check
//   2  the gate could not run — a surface was unreachable, unreadable, or a parser
//      broke. FAIL-CLOSED. An unreachable registry is never "n/a"; a gate that
//      skips is a gate that lies.
